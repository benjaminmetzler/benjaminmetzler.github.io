    <p>This page should re-direct to my Mastodon instance.</p>

    <p>Elon's decided that Mastodon is malware and is hiding pointers to it behind scary messages. It's not scary at all.</p>

    <p>The only thing wrong with Mastodon is that it's a competitor to Twitter and that frightens Elon. He is scared that he will lose a critical mass of twitter users to alternative platforms.</p>

    <p>You, as a reader, should be able to visit sites without him filtering them. He says he is for free speech, but really he's for himself.</p>
